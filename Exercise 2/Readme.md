1st part:
Write a programm which takes as input 
a positive integer number and prints how many digits the number has.
Finding the number of digits shall be done by both a recursive function "count_digits1" and 
both a non-recursive function "count_digits2"

2nd part:
Write a programm which reads numbers from a .txt file and inserts them in a binary search tree
structure . Creat a recursive function named "printLeafs" which prints all the leaves of the tree
from the left to the write. The bst.c and bst.h files were provided by my lecturer
