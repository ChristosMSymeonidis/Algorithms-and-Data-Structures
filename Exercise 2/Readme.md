1st part:
Write a programm which takes as input 
a positive integer number and prints how many digits the number has.
Finding the amount of digits shall be done by both a recursive function named "count_digits1" and 
 a non-recursive function named "count_digits2"

2nd part:
Write a programm which reads numbers from a number.txt file (create this file and fill it in your main() code) and inserts them in a binary search tree
structure . Creat a recursive function named "printLeafs" which prints the values of all the leaves of the tree
from the left to the write. The bst.c and bst.h files were provided by my lecturer
