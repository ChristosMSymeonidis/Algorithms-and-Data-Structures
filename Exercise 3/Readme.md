Use the codes for the algorithms insertionsort , quicksort and mergesort.
Write a programm which will runs the sorting algorithms on arrays sized from
20000 up to 200000 with a step of 20000. In each dimension create 10 shots of the arrays 
with random numbers . For every run of an algorithm measure the time it takes for the sorting.
